                            The yield curve is the difference (or spread) between the yield on the 10-year Treasury bond
                            and the yield on a shorter-term Treasury bond—for example, the 3-month or the 1-year. The
                            yield curve is flattening if short-term rates are increasing relative to long-term rates,
                            which is what’s been happening lately. The yield curve is inverted if short-term rates
                            exceed long-term rates, making the spread negative. Inverted yield curves have historically
                            been reliable predictors of impending recessions, which is why people are paying so much
                            attention to the yield curve own. In December 2013, the spread between long and short rates
                            was very close to 3 percent. In
                            October 2018, 0.86 percent for the 10-year and 3-month yields. If the yield curve were to
                            continue its downward trend from its previous high in December 2013, the yield curve would
                            invert in August 2019 (using the 10-year and 3-month yields). Historically, this would
                            predict a recession sometime in 2020. As the yield curve flattens, we can expect economists
                            and financial markets will closely monitor its level and make many predictions about whether
                            and when a recession will follow

                            The effective federal funds rate is the interest rate banks charge each other for overnight
                            loans to meet their reserve requirements. Also known as the federal funds rate. The federal
                            funds market consists of domestic unsecured borrowings in U.S. dollars by depository
                            institutions from other depository institutions and certain other entities, primarily
                            government-sponsored enterprises. Additionally, the federal funds rate indirectly influences
                            longer- term interest rates such as mortgages, loans, and savings, all of which are very
                            important to consumer wealth and confidence</p>

                            The yield, or return on purchasing a bond, depends on its face value, price, and time to
                            maturity. Because the bond's maturity and its face value are fixed, the price and yield and
                            inversely related. When demand for bonds is high the price rises and the yield falls. Bonds
                            issued by the U.S. Treasury are considered to be "default-free" and tend to attract
                            risk-averse investors. In the graph, the yield on the actively traded,
                            non-inflation-indexed, 10-year Treasury bonds issues is adjusted to constant maturities.
                            . Historically, the 10 Year treasury rate reached 15.15% in
                            1981 as the Fed raised benchmark rates in an effort to contain inflation.</p>

                            5 Year Treasury Rate is at 0.36%, compared to 0.36% the previous market day and 2.33% last

                            The 5 Year Treasury Rate is the yield received for investing in a US government issued
                            treasury security that has a maturity of 5 years. The 5 Year treasury yield is used as a
                            reference point in valuing other securities, such as corporate bonds. The 5 year treasury
                            yield is included on the longer end of the yield curve. Historically, the 5 Year treasury
                            yield reached as high as 15.93% in 1981, as the Federal Reserve was aggressively raising
                            benchmark rates in an effort to contain inflation.

                            5 Year Treasury Rate is at 0.36%, compared to 0.36% the previous market day and 2.33% last
                            year. This is lower than the long term average of 3.93%.

                            The 5 Year Treasury Rate is the yield received for investing in a US government issued
                            treasury security that has a maturity of 5 years. The 5 Year treasury yield is used as a
                            reference point in valuing other securities, such as corporate bonds. The 5 year treasury
                            yield is included on the longer end of the yield curve. Historically, the 5 Year treasury
                            yield reached as high as 15.93% in 1981, as the Federal Reserve was aggressively raising
                            benchmark rates in an effort to contain inflation.

                            The Industrial Production Index is an economic indicator that measures real output
                            for all facilities located in the United States manufacturing, mining, and electric, and gas
                            utilities (excluding those in U.S. territories). While the industrial activity plunged in
                            March because of the economic effects stemming from social-distancing orders in response to
                            the COVID-19
                            pandemic. Millions of businesses have closed or been disrupted, and mass layoffs have
                            occurred. But the March IP index of 103.66 is still far higher than the level registered
                            during the depth of the recession and financial crisis, which was 87.07 in June 2009. The IP
                            index is one of the nation’s longest continuously produced economic indicators, starting in
                            January 1919. It measures production (real output) of manufacturers, mining (e.g., oil and
                            natural gas), and electric and gas utilities and steadily increases over time; but it is
                            highly sensitive to the state of the economy and falls during recessions, generally
                            proportionate to the depth and duration of the recession. The 2007-2009 recession and
                            financial crisis is a prime example.
